# KNOTT-Python-Portfolio

The purpose of this portfolio is to be an organizer of all of my projects, work, visualizations, and models that are python related.

I plan on organizing my folders and files in this order:
  * School Related
      * Project 1
        * Code
        * Visualizations
      * Project 2. etc
  *Outside Projects
      * Project 1
        * Code
        * Visualizations
      * Project 2. etc
  *Miscellaneous

By doing this I will separate project materials first by type of project, name of project, and then type of material within said project.
